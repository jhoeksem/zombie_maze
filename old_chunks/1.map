The Murky River
As you slowly creep ahead on the path you notice the path bends to the west as there is a raging river to the north.
It looks murky and is moving at a fast pace. You feel like you would drown if you tried to swim across, maybe if you were a pole vaulter you could cross.

Looking around you see a river to the north, and the path forward leads to the west. There is a semidecayed wolf carcass on the side of the road.
