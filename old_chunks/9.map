You walk past the hut on your left. You are straing further and further from where you began your journey. Suddenly the earth begins to tremble and you lose your balance. Well, not exactly. The ground has fallen from under your feet and pretty quickly you relize you are falling into a pitch black abyss. 
You see some lights below. A river ahead, that same old hut to your left, a sign behind you, and a throne to your right. Were should you land?

Pitch black then lights, again.
