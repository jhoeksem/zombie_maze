1/8/674 I finally found the bridge to cross this stupid river, but to my surprise I found two figures standing in front of it. A mage and a knight. I cannot believe my eyes, the legendary Margrette “Stormbringer” and Tom “Rampage” Anderson. The two most renowned adventurers of their times. Their son had fallen ill to an incurable disease and they took on the forest to try to get the fairy to heal their son. They never returned and their son died alone, it is a tragic tale sung by many bards in sleepy taverns. I want to cry seeing that the worst had happened to them. Maybe if I could find a memento of their kid, I can break them of their curse. -D.L.
