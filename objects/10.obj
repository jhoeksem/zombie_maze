I see a figure in the distance radiating evil energy; it is him. My heart wonâ€™t stop pounding. My time has finally come. I prepare my sword, making sure it is sharp enough to cut through end tempered Mithril. If I make a mistake I will end up like Margrette and Tom, cursed to be his dog. Deep breaths I have to do this. There is no turning back. -D.L.
