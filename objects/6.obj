The wolf had thankfully left to go hunting, so I managed to get by. I found a clearing, but there was an evil looking fog to the north. There is a sign post with a riddle on it to remove the fog. Is the Lich toying with me now. Why did he go through the trouble of setting this up?  I bet he is watching me struggle to find the answer and laughing. -D.L.
