Last night I got so frustrated by the puzzle that I gave up and decided to go to bed for the night. I made a little campfire and set up my sleeping bag to sleep. When I woke up in the morning, the fog disappeared! I do not know what happened, but I will not argue with it. Lich I will make sure to pay you back big time for this stupid riddle! -D.L.
