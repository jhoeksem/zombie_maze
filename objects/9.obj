Its no use, I cannot figure out how to save the adventurers. I forced my way past them, I have to get to the Lich. He has to pay. It is said, he was once a human who made a wish for the power of a god. The fairy gave him the power of resurrection, but that was not enough for him. He manipulated the spell to instead steal life force from weakened corpses and curse the host. He quickly turned the once beautiful forest into an undead hell. It is said that he went mad from the cursed power he gained and is only focused on killing the fairy, though the spring she sleeps in blocks evil from entering it. This is no longer about me getting fame, coming here made me realize, he is a calamity that needs to be stopped. If I somehow get to the fairy, before I find him, I would tell her my wish is “kill the lich” to make sure he is scrubbed from existence.
