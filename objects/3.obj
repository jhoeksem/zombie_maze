Today I entered the Forest of Broken Dreamsâ„¢. I feel contradicting emotions of excitement and pure terror as I walk past the archway. My heart pounds as I look around with creepy dark trees surrounding me. I will overcome this Forest and become the most famous adventurer. There is anyone in this plane who does not know the name Dave Lebling. -D.L.
