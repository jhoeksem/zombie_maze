Straying down a path I found a strange hut. I had heard there used to leave a tribe of gnomes in the area before the Lich took over the forest. This might be from that time. The door is well made, despite its age, and I cannot seem to get in. I tried the window, but it would not budge. Just as I was going to try to break it, a hoard of zombies rushed me, so I had to run. If I ever get back I might try to break it. -D.L.
