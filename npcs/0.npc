Wolf
1
While thinking about the river you hear a guttural snarl from behind you, and the thick smell of decay hits you. It is a wolf with grey fur, speckled with a deep red. You notice part of its right cheek is missing, exposing its teeth, and its left paw is missing its flesh, showing just bone. It is in an attack position.
It growls at you.
The wolf corpse lies on the ground, finally finding rest.
