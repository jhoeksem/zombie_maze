Cursed Witch
3
There is a woman in a black silk robe with fine gold embroidery. She wields a staff with a brillant green gem stone on top. As you get closer, you notice her face is limp, and pale and her left eye has fallen out and there are maggots swarming in the socket.
We are the guardians of this bridge. Cursed to stop all who try to cross this bridge. Turn back now else you will suffer the same fate as us.
The corpse of a witch lies on the side of the road.
