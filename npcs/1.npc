Black Knight
3
You notice a figure standing in front of the bridge. A giant of a man in a jet black suit of plate armor. He is easily over 6'6" tall, with biceps as big as your head. He buried the tip of his great sword into the ground and is holding onto the handle.
He just stands there menacingly.
The corpse of the knight is lying on the side of the road.
