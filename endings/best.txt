The fairy looks at you wide eyed for a second before bursting into a massive fit of laughter.
"Thank you so much, you have idea no long I have waited for that answer.
My dad sent the Lich to as punishment for a totally stupid reason you know. 
Like I just told my brother how much fun managing the spring is, and I'd let him do it if he paid me a bit of money.
Its not my fault my brother is an idiot for fell for that. 
But now that you made that wish I can finally go on vacation, and let someone else manage the spring.
I have been here for over 12 centuries that like almost half of my summer break wasted, so unfair right?
Well enough rambling, I will grant your wish and as a bonus I will give you a thousand coins of pure gold and the title of Hero.
I will teleport you home now. Thank you."
The Fairy wraps you in a cyan light and then everything goes black.
After a time passed that could of been either seconds or decades, you realize that you are back in the bed of your home.
Looking at the foot of your bed you see a chest of gold, you are now rich.
GAME CLEARED! CONGRADULATIONS!
