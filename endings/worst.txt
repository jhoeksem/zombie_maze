As say your wish, you hear a deep voice from behind you.
He says "You have some nerve asking for a wish after killing my daughter. 
I put her here as pushiment for tricking her siblings into doing her duties, to teach her responibility. 
I never would of thought there would be a human stupid enough to actually attack her, nevertheless kill her.
Perhaps letting humans exist on my plane was a mistake."
You feel a sharp pain in your abdomen as the world turns to black.
GAME OVER.
