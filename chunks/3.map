Gaurdians of The Bridge
You hear the sound of the murky river flowing. You notice a bridge that seems to allow you to cross it.
However, there stands two imposing figures blocking the bridge.
Standing slightly forward is a giant of a man in a jet black suit of plate armor. He is easily over 6'6" tall, with biceps as big as your head. He buried the tip of his great sword into the ground and is holding onto the handle.
Behind him is a woman in a black silk robe with fine gold embroidery. She wields a staff with a brillant green gem stone on top.
As you get closer, you notice her face is limp, and pale and her left eye has fallen out and there are maggots swarming in the socket.
As you approach the duo they lift up their weapons and prepare for battle.
POST
There is a bridge that passes over the murky river. The bodies of the two zombies blocking the bridge lay together at the side of the path.
Their greatsword and staff also lay on the ground.
The path forward is north and south to retreat.
