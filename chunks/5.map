Fairy's Grotto
As you walk down the path, you see a beautiful fountain in the middle of a pool filled with crystal clear water.
As you walk up to it, a floating woman smiles at you. She is wearing a dress made out of leads, that contrast her fire red hair.
She thanks you for your hard work in getting this far, but unfortunately the Lich has 3 bodies that he splits his souls across, 1 of which is hidden deep in the trees.
As long as one is still alive, he can resurrect the others. 
Still for your bravery, I will grant you one wish and teleport you back to your hometown.
POST
After granting your wish the Fairy wraps you in a cyan light and then everything goes black.
After a time passed that could of been either seconds or decades, you realize that you are back in the bed of your home.
