Entrance to the Forest
You stand at the entrance of the Zombie Mazeâ„¢. There is an archway made up of two dead trees curving and interwining together.
You feel like there are a thousand eyes staring at you as you approach and if you look close enough you can see some red dots in the thick forest.
There is a fog that limits your visiblity but their seems to be a dirt path forward into the forest.
