The old hut
You continue walking until there is a clearing. There you see and old hut that is barely standing. It is surrounded by rocks and it is old and barren from the oustide. Upon arriving at the front door you try to open it with no luck. Curiously you begin to circle the house. There it is: a window slightly open directly in front of you. Perhaps this is a way in.
POST
The window lays open that from the outside shows a fully furnished home that has been visibly abandoned in a hurry.
