The Sign Post and The Miasma
You enter a circular clearing. There is a sign placed prominently in the center.
To the north there seems to be an opening in the trees, but it is clouded in a thick black miasma.
From a distance you can already smell the toxic fumes from the miasma, you would not want to get close to that.
The sign reads:
To get past the deadly miasma you must solve this riddle:

What is thick, yet thin as a puff? And you know its danager is not a bluff?

It grows larger from what it has eaten, but give it a drink of water, and you'll have it beaten.

It can flatten a village and swallow a forest, yet adventures sit around one while they rest.

Hint: type the answer in the command prompt to move on.
POST
Looking around you see the miasma from the north has dispersed, allowing safe travels, or you can head back to the east.
