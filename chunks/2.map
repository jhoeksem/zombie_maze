The Sign Post and The Miasma
You enter a circular clearing. There is a sign placed prominently in the center.
To the north there seems to be an opening in the trees, but it is clouded in a thick black miasma.
From a distance you can already smell the toxic fumes from the miasma, you would not want to get close to that.
POST
Looking around you see the miasma from the north has dispersed, allowing safe travels, or you can head back to the east.
