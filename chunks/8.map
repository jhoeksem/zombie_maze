Throne of Thorns
You see a giant clearing with a throne made of thorny vines in the middle. 
POST
The clearing shows signs of a mighty battle, with torn-up dirt and smoldering fires from the lightning strikes. 
You look at the throne of thorns and wonder if he was a masochist for building something so painful.
To the north is a path bathed in soft golden light.
