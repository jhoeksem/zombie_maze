The Murky River
As you slowly creep ahead on the path you notice the path bends to the west as there is a raging river to the north.
It looks murky and is moving at a fast pace. You feel like you would drown if you tried to swim across, maybe if you were a pole vaulter you could cross.
While thinking about the river you hear a guttural snarl from behind you, and the thick smell of decay hits you. 
It is a wolf with grey fur, speckled with a deep red. You notice part of its right cheek is missing, exposing its teeth, and its left paw is missing its flesh, showing just bone.
It poses on you.

Looking around you see a river to the north, and the path forward leads to the west. There is a semidecayed wolf carcass on the side of the road.
