Massive Field
The field sits on the edge of the Forest of Broken Dreamsâ„¢. 
You feel like there are thousands of eyes watching you from the thicket of dead trees ringing the field. 
There are obvious wooden arches to the north, east, and west.
You can't be sure, but it seems like each arch indicates a path through the dense trees.
