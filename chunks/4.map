Throne of Thorns
You see a giant clearing with a throne made of thorny vines in the middle. 
POST
The clearing shows sign of the mighty battle, with torn up dirt and smoldering fires from the lightning strikes.
You look at the throne of thorns and wonder if he was a masochist for building something so painful looking.
Looking to the north you see a path bathed in a golden light.
