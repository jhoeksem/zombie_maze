Throne of Thorns
You see a giant clearing with a throne made of thorny vines in the middle. 
Sitting on the throne is a man with a wicked smile. His robes look like they were once very ordinate, though now they are worn and torn.
He chuckles and congradulates you for being the first in getting this far in decades, as he  gets up from his seat.
He pulls out a giant golden greatsword and holds it up to the sky, summoning a lightning strike through it.
It crackles with energy.
"You will make a great stepping stone from me to finally kill the fairy." he says and he rushes you.
POST
The clearing shows sign of the mighty battle, with torn up dirt and smoldering fires from the lightning strikes.
You look at the throne of thorns and wonder if he was a masochist for building something so painful looking.
Looking to the north you see a path bathed in a golden light.
