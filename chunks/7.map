The Springs of Fresh Hope
Despite a forest canopy usually blotting out the sun, a yellow vertical beam of light illuminates a pool of water.
The water is calming, juxtaposed with the surrounding brutality of nature. 
This is a place to rest and heal. 
There is a foreboding passage deep in shade; it leads north.
