The living room of frights
You enter the room and see that it looks strangely like home. A fully furnished living room and house that has suffered from the lack of cleaning. 
It now looks like mold is beginning to develop on the ceiling, but the furniture isn't covered. There are actually toys on the ground next to sofa on your right and a tv on your left. 
The old owners certainly didn't care to pack up before leaving. You walk deeper into the room  and see the front door to your left and a new door to your right. You realize the front door wasn't locked but rather barricaded by wood that had been nailed to not allow for the door to open. All of the keys are still on the keyholder. Hint: use your surroundings
POST
The room looks just as gloomy as before the outside moon illuminating through the window.
